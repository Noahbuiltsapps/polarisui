# PolarisUI

PolarisUI is an open-source component library built on top of Shopify’s native Polaris design system. It extends the official Polaris components with extra patterns, utilities, and ready-to-use blocks, designed to speed up development of Remix-powered Shopify apps.

## Website  

The official website is currently being built and will be available soon at [polaris-ui.com](https://polaris-ui.com).  

In the meantime, you can already check out the placeholder site, which is fully functional and showcases the first components:
